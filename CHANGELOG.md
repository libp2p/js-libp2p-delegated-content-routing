* The ipfs-http-client must now be installed
as a peer dependency. It is no longer included as a dependency
of this module.

The reason the http-client should be a peerDependency and
not a dependency is that its API requires knowledge of the
http-client (we pass in the api endpoint details).
* findProviders returns id and addrs properties instead of peer-info instance

* chore: address review
